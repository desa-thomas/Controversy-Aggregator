## About
**Corporate News Aggregator** is a full-stack web application focused on tracking and organizing news related to company ethics. It combines public company data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) with real-time news articles from [GNews](https://gnews.io/), categorized by ethical themes such as **labor**, **environment**, **privacy**, and **governance**.

The app retrieves:
- Company metadata (industry, logo, description) from Wikidata
- Relevant news articles from GNews based on [ethical categories](/backend/ethics_categories.py) 

This tool offers a convenient platform for:

- Researching corporate business practices
- Exploring industry-specific media coverage through an ethical lens

The frontend, built with JavaScript and HTML, is hosted on GitHub, while the backend â€” powered by Python (Flask) and MariaDB â€” runs on my Raspberry Pi at home.

ðŸš§ _Note:_ The frontend and API are still under active development. Once stable, the app will be hosted publicly. In the meantime, you're welcome to:

- Browse the codebase
- View [screenshots](/screenshots)
- Or host the application locally by following the setup instructions
